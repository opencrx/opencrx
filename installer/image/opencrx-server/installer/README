Welcome to openCRX!
-------------------

This installer has created an openCRX instance running on
Apache TomEE (see http://openejb.apache.org/apache-tomee.html) 
and HSQLDB. The installation comes with a preconfigured database.

You can start and stop openCRX using the corresponding shortcuts
on the desktop created by the installer. After starting openCRX 
login to openCRX using a browser pointing to the URL

http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-core-CRX

The following accounts are pre-configured (UserId / Password):
* guest / guest
* admin-Standard / admin-Standard
* admin-Root / admin-Root

Troubleshooting
---------------
When you are not able to login then try the following:

* Open an command shell
* cd to ${installdir}/apache-tomee-webprofile-1.7.1/bin
* Start openCRX with opencrx.bat run in Windows platforms
  or ./opencrx.sh run in Linux platforms
* Check the console output for errors

WorkflowController
------------------
Here is how to start the workflow controller:

* Login as admin-Root
* Select Administration then the menu entry
  Wizards > openCRX Workflow Controller.
* This activates and opens the WorkflowController servlet.
  'Turn on' / 'Turn off' allows to activate and deactivate
  openCRX background services.
