          openCRX Database Scripts for HSQLDB 2

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes known problems and solutions with the openCRX
   database scripts for HSQLDB.

   upgrade-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: These scripts must 
   be executed to upgrade the database from <version-from> to <version-to>. 
   E.g. If you have a database of version 1.4.0 and you want to upgrade to
   version 1.6.0 you must run the scripts from-1.4.0-to-1.5.0, from-1.5.0-
   to-1.6.0.
  
   NOTE: the execution of the upgrade scripts is mandatory.
   
   migrate-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: The migrate scripts
   allow to migrate data from <version-from> to <version-to>. If you have
   made your own database extension you must add your own migration
   code. 
   
   NOTE: the execution of the migrate scripts is optional.
